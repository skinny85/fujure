Files in this subproject are automatically generated by [BNFC](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/).
Don't edit them by hand.

To regenerate these files after a change to `Fujure.cf`,
issue a command in this directory similar to:

```bash
bnfc --java --antlr4 -m -o src/main/java -p org.fujure.fjc.bnfc.antlr Fujure.cf
CLASSPATH=`pwd`/lib/* make -C src/main/java
```

After `make` succeeds, Gradle should take over compiling the generated files.
After your change, try to build the project with Gradle;
if it succeeds, commit the changed/added files in `src/main/java`.

#### Installing BNFC

BNFC is actually quite tricky to install, as it's a Haskell project.
The simplest way seems to be compiling it from source -
try the instructions [here](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc#installation).
After the build succeeds, the executable will be somewhere inside the `source` directory -
for me, it was `<git_repo_root>/source/dist/build/bnfc/bnfc`.

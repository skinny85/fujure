This module contains a parser (complete with a lexer)
autogenerated from the [Fujure.cf](Fujure.cf) file using the
[BNFC](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc) tool.
The actual parsing algorithm is implemented by delegating to
[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/).

Since this is generated code, don't edit it by hand.
To regenerate these files after a change to `Fujure.cf`,
issue a command in this directory similar to:

```bash
bnfc --java --antlr4 -m -o src/main/java -p org.fujure.fbc.parser.bnfc.antlr Fujure.cf
CLASSPATH=`pwd`/lib/* make -C src/main/java
make clean -C src/main/java # this only removes the generated .class files
```

After `make` succeeds, Gradle should take over compiling the generated files.
After your change, try to build the project with Gradle;
if it succeeds, commit the changed/added files in `src/main/java`.
